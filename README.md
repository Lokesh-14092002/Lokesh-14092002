	<li><i><a href="https://github.com/Lokesh-14092002/email_alert_app.git">Email Alert Application</a></i>:<ul><li>In this era of hectic schedules and constant work pressure, it is very difficult for anyone to keep up with and track regarding everything. The human mind may not be able to retain information for a very long time and may be replaced with more important work and information, which can result in some losses that may befinancial or educational. Missing crucial emails, such as job notifications, company emails, and college mail, which may contain deadlines, critical messages, and essential information, is one of the concern.</li>

<li>Real-Time Alerts: Get alerted in real-time when important emails arrive, allowing you to respond promptly and stay on top of time-sensitive matters.
Efficient Communication: Seamless Integration: Connect your email accounts to create a unified communication experience, reducing the need to switch between multiple platforms.
Timely Response: Priority Handling: Focus on emails that trigger alerts, ensuring quick responses to urgent matters and preventing critical emails from getting buried.
Personalized Updates: Targeted Alerts: Tailor your notifications based on sender importance or email content, ensuring that only relevant emails trigger app notifications.</li>
<li>The Project is to create an automated system that notifies the incoming email specifically emails that may be necessary, critical, and have some urgency, through an Application in the form of automatic alerts, which would give users a reminder of those specific emails</li></ul></li>
	<li><i><a href="https://github.com/Lokesh-14092002/Eye-View-Tracker-For-Online-Exam.git">Eye-View Tracker for Online Examination</a></i>:<ul><li>This project proposes an "Eye View Tracker for Online Examination" that makes use of the webGazer library to track students' eye movements during online exams. The webGazer library is a JavaScript-based eye-tracking library that tracks the user's eye movements using the computer's webcam. The Eye View Tracker for Online Examination is a novel instrument designed to improve the integrity of online exams and provide a fair and just evaluation procedure. 
<li>The webGazer library is integrated into an online examination platform by the Eye View Tracker for Online Examination, which is developed as a web-based application. During an online exam, the Eye View Tracker monitors the student's eye movements and detects any odd behaviour that could indicate academic cheating.</li> <li> The technical aspects of the project involve the incorporation of the webGazer library into the web-based application and the development of algorithms to detect suspicious behavior based on eye-tracking data. The research also explores the merits and drawbacks of using eye-tracking technology in online exams. Overall, the Eye View Tracker for Online Examinations is a useful tool for maintaining the integrity of online tests and ensuring that students are evaluated fairly and justly.</li></ul></li>
